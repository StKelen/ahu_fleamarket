# AHU FleaMarket
## Intro
This project is my undergraduate graduation project.

The backend codebase can be found in the [back-end branch](https://github.com/StKelen/ahu_fleamarket/tree/back-end), and the frontend codebase is located in the [flutter branch](https://github.com/StKelen/ahu_fleamarket/tree/flutter).

The backend was implemented using Golang with the Gorm ORM and a MySQL database. The mobile application was developed using the Flutter framework.

The application provides the following functionalities: user registration and login, the ability for users to publish product information (including uploading images, editing the description, and setting the price), and private chat between users.
